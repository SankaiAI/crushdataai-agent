Mistake Type,Description,Symptoms,Prevention Query,User Question
Duplicate Inflation,Counting same record multiple times due to duplicates or join multiplication,"Total much higher than expected; sum doesn't match source","SELECT id, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM table GROUP BY id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1","Does the total of X seem reasonable compared to other reports?"
Wrong Granularity,Aggregating at wrong level (user vs session vs event),"Numbers don't match other reports; unexpected row counts","SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) FROM table","Is this data one row per user, per session, or per event?"
Missing Filter,Forgot to exclude test users, internal accounts, or invalid data,"Numbers include test data; higher than expected","SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@company.com' OR email LIKE '%test%'","Should we exclude internal/test users? Any known filters?"
Timezone Mismatch,Comparing dates in different timezones causing misalignment,"Day totals don't match other reports; off-by-one errors","SELECT DISTINCT date_trunc('day', ts AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') vs AT TIME ZONE 'PST'","What timezone should I use for date calculations?"
Survivorship Bias,Only analyzing users who completed journey ignoring dropoffs,"Metrics look too good; missing failed attempts","Check: are we only looking at users who converted?","Are we analyzing all users or only those who [completed action]?"
Simpson's Paradox,Aggregate trend opposite of subgroup trends,"Conflicting conclusions; unexpected direction","Compare aggregate vs segment-level trends","Should we break this down by [segment] to check for hidden patterns?"
Incomplete Time Period,Comparing full period to partial period,"Latest period looks lower than historical","Check if latest period has full data: WHERE date < current_date","Is the latest time period complete, or should we exclude it?"
Wrong Join Type,Using INNER when LEFT needed or vice versa,"Missing rows; unexpected nulls; row count changes","Compare row counts before and after join","The join produced X rows from Y original rows. Does this match expectation?"
Null Handling Errors,NULLs excluded from aggregations unexpectedly,"Lower counts than expected; divisions by zero","SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(column), SUM(CASE WHEN column IS NULL THEN 1 END)","How should we handle missing/null values in this analysis?"
Off-by-One Date Errors,BETWEEN includes endpoints; wrong date boundary,"One extra or missing day; period mismatch","Check: date >= start AND date < end (exclusive end)","Should the date range include or exclude the end date?"
Metric Definition Mismatch,Using different definition than stakeholder expects,"Numbers don't match expectations; confusion","Document exact definition before starting","How does your team define [metric]? What's included/excluded?"
Currency Unit Confusion,Mixing dollars and cents or different currencies,"Numbers off by factor of 100 or exchange rate","Check: are amounts in dollars or cents? One currency?","Are these amounts in dollars or cents? Same currency throughout?"
Seasonality Ignored,Comparing periods with different seasonal patterns,"Invalid conclusions; unfair comparisons","Compare same period last year, not sequential periods","Should we compare to same period last year to account for seasonality?"
Selection Bias,Analyzing non-representative sample,"Conclusions don't generalize; biased insights","Check how sample was selected; compare to population","Is this sample representative of all users, or a specific subset?"
Correlation vs Causation,Claiming causation from correlation,"Incorrect business recommendations","Check: is there a plausible mechanism? Control for confounders?","Does X actually cause Y, or are they just correlated?"
Cherry Picking Dates,Choosing date range that shows desired narrative,"Misleading conclusions; not reproducible","Use standard reporting periods; document why dates chosen","Why was this specific date range chosen?"
Aggregation Level Mismatch,Comparing metrics calculated at different levels,"Apples to oranges comparison; invalid conclusions","Ensure both metrics use same denominator/level","Are both these metrics calculated the same way (same level)?"
Data Latency Issues,Using stale data that hasn't propagated fully,"Recent periods look incomplete; inconsistent","Check data freshness: MAX(updated_at), pipeline completion","Is this data fully loaded? When was it last updated?"
Calculation Errors,Wrong formula for complex metrics,"Metrics don't match known correct values","Validate against known correct calculation or source","Can we validate this against another source or manual calculation?"
Presentation Bias,Chart design exaggerating or hiding patterns,"Misleading visualizations; wrong conclusions","Check: y-axis starts at zero? Scale appropriate?","Does this chart accurately represent the data without distortion?"
