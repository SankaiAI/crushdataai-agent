Heatmap,Correlations or matrix data,Numerical Matrix,Distribution,"sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='RdBu_r')","Diverging palette for correlation (-1 to 1); sequential for counts","Include value annotations; use colorblind-safe palette","Perfect for cohort retention tables"
Histogram,Distribution of single variable,Numerical,Distribution,"plt.hist(df['value'], bins=30)","Single color; consider outlier highlighting","Include mean/median line; label bin count","Use to understand data distribution before analysis"
Box Plot,Distribution comparison,Numerical,Distribution Comparison,"sns.boxplot(data=df, x='category', y='value')","One color per category; highlight outliers","Explain quartile meanings; include n count","Great for comparing distributions across groups"
Violin Plot,Distribution with density,Numerical,Distribution,"sns.violinplot(data=df, x='category', y='value')","Paired colors for split violins; sequential otherwise","More intuitive than box plots for some users","Good for showing bimodal distributions"
Funnel Chart,Sequential step conversion,Categorical,Drop-off,"import plotly.express as px; px.funnel(df, x='count', y='stage')","Blues from dark to light (top to bottom); or brand colors","Label conversion percentages between stages","Essential for showing conversion drop-off"
Waterfall Chart,Cumulative effect of values,Categorical,Contribution,"Use plotly or custom matplotlib with positive/negative coloring","Green for positive; red for negative; gray for subtotals","Start with total; show increases and decreases clearly","Great for bridge charts (start to end explanation)"
Gauge Chart,Single KPI with target,Single Value,Target,"Use plotly Indicator or custom graphic","Green/yellow/red zones based on targets","Include actual value and target","Use sparingly - one per major KPI"
KPI Card,Single important metric,Single Value,Status,"Text display with conditional formatting","Color based on performance (green/amber/red)","Large font; include trend arrow and context","Top of dashboard for most important metrics"
Sparkline,Compact trend indicator,Time-series,Trend,"Line chart rendered small without axes","Single color; consistent across dashboard","May be too small for some users","Great alongside KPI cards to show trend"
Table,Detailed data viewing,Multi-dimensional,Detail,"df.style.format() with conditional formatting","Alternate row colors; highlight important values","Ensure sufficient contrast; limit columns","Place at bottom of dashboard for drill-down"
